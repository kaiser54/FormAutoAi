## Original User Request:
Develop a Chrome extension that leverages AI to automate the filling of job application forms. The extension should function similarly to Grammarly, displaying an icon adjacent to each input field on a job application form. Upon clicking this icon, the extension should intelligently populate the corresponding field with relevant information. The AI component should be capable of extracting and understanding the context of each field to ensure accurate and appropriate data entry. The extension should be user-friendly, providing clear visual cues and feedback during the form-filling process. Consider the design of the icon and its placement to ensure it is unobtrusive yet easily accessible. The extension should also handle different types of input fields, such as text areas, dropdown menus, and radio buttons. The AI should be able to adapt to various form layouts and structures. The extension should also include a settings panel where users can customize the AI's behavior, such as specifying preferred data sources or adjusting the level of automation. The extension should also provide a mechanism for users to review and edit the AI-generated content before submitting the form.
